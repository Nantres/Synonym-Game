You are given a word and you have to input a synonym of that word. It's basically for practicing your paraphrasing ability.

### Gist of how it works:
- uses a list of most, if not all, of the words in the English dictionary (370105 words)
- this list is then further filtered to only include <ins>words with synonyms</ins> (wws) and <ins>words by frequency</ins> (wbf). So that means only somewhat more commonly used words are included and words without synonyms are excluded.
- final word count: 61295

- more frequently used words at the top:

- you need the wbf folder with the python file in the same folder for it to work

### limitations:
- some words used are too difficult and are not commonly used, but it's difficult to filter them out.
- you can't adjust the difficulty
